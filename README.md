# 8mu editor

The 8mu editor allows you to edit the configuration of your 8mu from within a web browser.

The 8mu editor is a rework of the 16n editor, a Javascript app based around [Svelte](svelte) built by Tom Armitage. The rest of these notes are largely his.

---

The 8mu editor allows you to edit the configuration of your 8mu from within a web browser. It supports 8mu hardware running firmware **1.0.0** and up.

The 8mu editor is a Javascript app based around [SvelteKit](sk).

Version 2.0.0 of the editor is a large overhaul, with a few goals:

- bring the codebase up-to-date with SvelteKit 1.x
- replace Javascript with Typescript throughout
- replace unpleasant attempts at object-orientation with a more ECMAScript-like code style, focused on modules exporting functions and POJOs.
- replace confusing (an understatement) message-passing, and focus on a more SvelteKit like way of doing things: put functions into the modules or components calling them, directly manipulate stores, and assume stores are a global store of truth.

The result is a little more readable by most JS developers, and we gain a lot of convenience as well as belt/braces security from the move to Typescript.

## Build Requirements

- Node.js v16+

## Usage Requirements

- As a WebMIDI app, you need a client that can support it. That basically means Chrome right now.
- A 8mu running firmware v1.0.0 or higher.

## Installation

    npm install

## Configuration

Note that `package.json` contains a `config` object that lets us specify the latest version of the firmware, thus triggering a prompt to update. This should be set to the latest version of the firmware.

## Running the development environment

    npm run dev

This will run a development environment at `localhost:5173`, with live reloading enabled.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

    npm run build

This will emit a production build, as a purely static site, to `build/`. You can run this version of the code with `npm run preview`.

## Deployment

The built site (in `/build`) is copied over to the 8mu site repository and deployed from there.

## Code formatting

We use `prettier` for code formatting. From your local directory:

    npm run format

will prettify the `src/` directory. Code that fails Prettier's formatting standards will block merge at Github.

Code linting is handled with ESLint, and code must meet the Prettier formatting standards in order to lint:

    npm run lint

Currently, the 8mu fork does _not_ enforce code style on push, unlike 16n.

## Project Structure

- the main page of the site is `src/routes/+page.svelte`. This performs basic WebMidi setup and hosts the two main "modes" of the site, represented as components `src/routes/Viewing.svelte` and `src/routes/Editing.svelte`. (These are stored within the 'route' directory as they're more like pages - supercomponents - than traditional Svelte components)
- `src/lib/components` contains all components; these are all UI elements. In general, they will reach out directly to any stores they need to address.
- `src/lib/configuration.ts` is a module exporting a set of functions for parsing and processing configuration data - generating a configuration POJO from a sysex array, comparing two configuration POJOs to see if they are identical.
- `src/lib/import_export.ts` exports functions to request a user for a JSON file and load it as a config - and to take the current config and offer it as a downloadable file. (These functions are used by DOM element button components).
- `src/lib/logger.ts` is a convenience function to log items to the console in development mode.
- `src/lib/stores.ts` exports the various stores that will be used throughout the application (see later)
- `src/lib/types.ts` exports custom types used within the application: notably, individual `Control` items, and an entire `ControllerConfiguration`
- `src/lib/midi/midi.ts` exports all the necessary functions to listen to MIDI ports as they connect/disconnect, request 8mu configs from appropriate devices, and listen to individual events from the connected devices.
- `src/lib/midi/sysex.ts` exports all the necessary functions to send the various System Exclusive messages a 8mu supports.

## Stores

Svelte uses stores to store state and react to state changes. `src/lib/stores.ts` contains all the stores the application uses. My preferred style, in a single-user, client-only application is just to write to stores directly whenever necessary.

There are a number of stores exported that are used throughout the application:

- `configuration` describes the current Configuration being shown in Viewing mode.
- `editConfiguration` is the current configuration being _edited_ in Editing mode.
- `editMode` is a boolean representing if the editor is in Editing mode or not.
- `midiInputs` and `midiOutputs` describes the currently connected MIDI input/output ports.
- `selectedMidiInput` and `selectedMidiOutput` represent the actual port that's used to talk to a 8mu.
- `webMidiEnabled` is a boolean representing if the current browser supports WebMidi.
